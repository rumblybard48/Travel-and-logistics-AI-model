Travel and logistics AI model
This repository contains a Streamlit-based multi-agent AI assistant that integrates two domain-specific conversational models powered by Google’s Gemini API. The Travel Assistant can calculate distances between cities, display local times, suggest packing lists, and determine timezones and country information using Geopy and timezone data. The Logistics Assistant combines Gemini’s reasoning with OpenRouteService and Geopy to estimate truck and air freight costs, recommend storage conditions for products, and resolve location coordinates. Both assistants expose their functionality through a clean chat interface built in Streamlit, enabling users to interact naturally while Gemini automatically calls underlying Python functions based on the user’s prompts.
